 Rebuild index statement is printed at partition level if
  a. RGQualityMeasure is not met for @PercentageRGQualityPassed Rowgroups 
    -- this is an arbitrary number, what we are saying is that if the average is above this number, don't bother rebuilding as we consider this number to be good quality rowgroups
 b. Second constraint is the Deleted rows, currently the default that is set am setting is 10% of the partition itself. If the partition is very large or small consider adjusting this
 c. In SQL 2014, post index rebuild,the dmv doesn't show why the RG is trimmed to < 1 million in this case in SQL 2014. 
   - If the Dictionary is full ( 16MB) then no use in rebuilding this rowgroup as even after rebuild it may get trimmed
   - If dictionary is full only rebuild if deleted rows falls above the threshold
